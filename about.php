							<h4>About Fish Room </h4>
							<p align="justify">Behind this Fish Room India E-commerce Store, there is a passionate hobbyist who had shown his interest in aquariums from his young days when he was just 8 years old. As you might not expect him to start his commercial venture in aquariums from his initial hobby days.</p>
							<p>His initial clients were established during his computer consultancy stint. Some of the tanks constructed during these formative years still stand as an example of his craftsmanship.</p>
							<p>India's first and largest online store for aquarium products based out of Howrah since 2006. Free & Express Delivery Pan India. Serving 10,000+ customers.
